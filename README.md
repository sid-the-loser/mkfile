# Questions you may have

- Does it work on other OSes?

It does. However, I will **only** be keeping track of its Windows compatibility.

- Is it easy to compile to other OSes?

Absolutely, but, I can't be bothered to keep making builds that work on anything else. I'm sorry. **DIY**!

- Why do you keep making these useless tools? Why do you post them on your GitHub?

Answer to the first question: I like making these tools. They're fun to make.

Answer to the second question: Because I can :smile:

- Why are you being so rude?

I'm having some major jet lag while writing this.
